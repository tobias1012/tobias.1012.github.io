Math parsers exist in an abundance and in a lot of different languages, this also applies to C++. But why use something that already exists if the goal is to learn the underlying technique? Well, i didn't know the answer and neither did my group members in a class Project, therefore we chose to write our own math parser that can also handle functions among other things, in with miniseries i will try to explain the steps we took to make a math parser that we could use for a bigger project: an open source CAS tool called DIophant.



# The Goal
