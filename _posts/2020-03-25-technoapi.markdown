A while ago a family member came to me and asked if i could develop some software for a gyms bikes they use for indoor cycling, as we talked about what this software should do it became clear that it could be useful to interface these bikes for different kinds of programs, some for fun like pong, while others are a bit more serious and should simulate cycling a specific route from a GPX file. This is how TechnoAPI came to be.
